Justification of Values used in initial weight estimate.
=======

1.0 Estimation and Justification of Values
1.1 Weight of people is the weight of the crew and the weight of the passengers.
According to the course documentation (CourseDocumentation document) crew
should be 80kg each and passengers should be 90kg each.Thus, 
2x80+2x90=340kg is the total weight of crew and passengers.

 1.2 Assuming that avionics and electronic training equipment and systems will
 be counted as part of the empty take-off weight, there is not a
 significant requirement for payload capacity in the design of a light
 trainer helicopter. Further, the helicopter will return to its departure
 the majority of the time as this is the nature of training sessions. This
 means that only a minor payload requirement would be needed. 
 It is possible that a greater capacity will be needed for shuttle journeys
 between locations. This could involve the transport of some small
 personal suitcases or light equipment. Thus, a good estimate for maximum payload capacity would be as follows; 
 assuming that there is a capacity for four people in the helicopter and that each person brings
 10 kilograms of luggage and there is no other equipment, this would result in a payload
 requirement of 40kg.

 1.3 Two 5-seat trainer helicopters, the Bell 505 Jet Ranger X and the
 Robinson R66 have fuel consumption values of 121 and 87 litres per hour.
 An estimate for the consumption of this helicopter during high
 consumption periods can be about 110 litres per hour. This would be when
 the aircraft is travelling a high speeds or conducting aggressive
 manoeuvres. For an endurance requirement of 3.6 hours and providing for
 maximum fuel consumption throughout this time period, a total fuel
 requirment of 3.6h x 110L/h = 396 litres.
 According to references, the density of aviation fuel at 15 degrees
 celsuis is apprixmately 0.715 kilograms per litre. Thus, the calculation
 of fuel mass requirement is completed in the subsequent calculation
 section.

 1.4 Empty weight of the Bell 505 is 989kg. Other trainer helicopters have
 heavier and lighter empty weights. After reviewing the helicopter weights
 provided by each group member's initial market survey, an average empty
 take-off weight estimate is between 850-950kg. 
 At this stage in the design process, it may be beneficial to select an
 empty weight that is on the lighter end of the spectrum for the design of a light trainer. This is because
 that would improve several performance characteristics of the helicopter from
 the start of the process. Starting with a lighter weight should stand the
 design in good stead by resulting in lower fuel consumption rates,
 greater weight allowed for payload and better range, speed, climb rate and endurance
 characteristics. On the other hand, the bell 505 does not support
 dual-pilot control despite its side-by-side cockpit seating layout. Thus
 more weight should be allowed for this design given that dual-control
 would be beneficial and safer for trainer missions. 
 With both of these factors in mind, the selected first estimate for the
 empty weight is 900kg.
